                    You can write a success story about a program, workshop or training opportunity that is particularly
                    noteworthy and significant. It may be about how an employer worked with an employment program or
                    about how a person gained personal employment.

                    I would try to always understand and accept the fact that the computer is not only faster than you,
                    it is more accurate than you. However, it can't think, and for that reason, all software is
                    literally written in the mind first. Some is generated, but it's generated again, from something
                    that was imagined first. Become an expert problem solver and you will be second to none as a
                    programmer.

                <h3 class="blog-title">List all the things that immediately come to your mind that you love.</h3>
                <p class="blog-description">
                    Give yourself 5-10 minutes and scribble out a messy list of all the things that come to mind when
                    you ask: What do I love?
                    Don't censor yourself. Write everything and anything that comes to mind.
                    Often a big part of the problem is that we don't give ourselves the time and space we need to
                    identify the things we enjoy. We never really reflect on what it is we need and what fills us up.
                    Some of the things I love: scented candles, hot showers, the beach, peppermint tea, beautiful
                    flowers, the smell of lavender oil, reading self-help books, snuggling with my corgi, the smell of
                    freshly cut grass, ice-cream, painting my nails, watching home remodeling shows…you get the gist!
                    The list doesn't need to have any form or sense about it. As you can see, mine is a mix of all sorts
                    of activities and experiences. If you want to organize it later you absolutely can. You may choose
                    to filter it into lists for “quick fixes”, “daily activities” and “big things” for example.

                    Think back to Your Childhood - What did you do in your spare time?
                </h3>
                <p class="blog-description">
                    Think back to your childhood and teen years and ask yourself, What did I do for fun? What were the
                    activities that you were interested in when there was no pressure from the outside world? What were
                    the games that you most loved to play?
                    For me, I loved to write. As a teenager, I wrote so many poems. I still have them in beautifully put
                    together books. When I was younger than that, I can also remember adoring music. I would play my
                    Dirty Dancing soundtrack over and over and sing with reckless abandon (who doesn’t love Hungry
                    Eyes!).
                    Perhaps you liked to color, or bake, or read books, or run around outside. There are no restrictions
                    to what may come up for you. Write from your heart.
                    The main aim of this question is to help you remember the things that used to bring you joy, that
                    perhaps you’ve forgotten to make space for in your life as you’ve grown.

                <h3 class="blog-title2"> What are you Curious about? What are some of the things you’re interested in
                    learning more about?</h3>
                <p class="blog-description2">
                    Grab your notepad and ask yourself – What am I curious about? What would I like to know more about,
                    or perhaps try doing?
                    In Western culture, we don’t put enough value on the things that simply just interest us a little
                    bit. Instead, we have come to overvalue things that are “productive” or move us towards a specific
                    goal. We don’t allow ourselves the time or space to explore that which we might find interesting.
                    Yet just like children, adults need to “play”. To feel truly happy in our hearts, from time-to-time
                    we need to do things just because we want to – not because we have anything to gain from it. Brene
                    Brown and Elisabeth Kubler-Ross (two famous people-researchers) both talk about this deep need
                    within us.
                    A list might include: tramping and bush walking, the history of Asia, cooking or cooking classes,
                    competitive card games, yoga, international travel.
                    The main aim of this question is to help you tap into the things that you might not yet know you
                    love. If you follow your inbuilt sense of curiosity you may just find a whole new bunch of things
                    that are worth trying that you may truly love.

                <h3 class="blog-title2">What would your Dream Day look like?</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="blog-description2">Ask yourself: If I was away from all of the pressures of real world stuff,
                    and money and time were no object, what would my dream day look like?
                    You can go into as much detail as you like, but I’d encourage you to really immerse yourself in what
                    this could look like for you.
                    Mine would include a few things that I’ve already mentioned above. Specifically, I would love to be
                    on the beach under a giant umbrella in a warm climate reading an excellent self-help book. I’d also
                    want to eat at an amazing restaurant and take a nap. There would be a lot more detail in my dream
                    day, but those would be some of the specifics. To summarize some of those points into things I love:
                    self-help books, traveling to warm climates, the beach, dinning in beautiful restaurants, and
                    napping.
                    The main aim of this question is to help you picture doing the things you love, rather than being
                    forced just to list them. It is a more practical way to envision it that may work better for some
                    people, or help you identify some more things that haven’t yet come up in your lists. </p>
